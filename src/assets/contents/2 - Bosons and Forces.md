- Photon:

The photon is a fundamental particle and the mediator of the ELETROMAGNETIC FORCE and ELETROMAGNETIC FIELD.

It carries the electromagnetic force between charged particles, such as electrons and protons.

Photons are massless and travel at the speed of light.

They are responsible for phenomena such as light, radio waves, X-rays, and gamma rays.

- W and Z Bosons:

The W and Z bosons are elementary particles and mediate the WEAK NUCLEAR FORCE and the WEAK FIELD.

The W bosons come in two charged varieties: W+ and W-. The Z boson is electrically neutral.

These bosons are involved in processes like radioactive decay and nuclear reactions.

The weak nuclear force is responsible for certain types of particle interactions, such as those involved in beta decay.

W bosons

The W± bosons are best known for their role in nuclear decay. Consider, for example, the beta decay of cobalt-60.

(60, 27)Co → (60, 28)Ni+ + e− + νe

This reaction does not involve the whole cobalt-60 nucleus, but affects only one of its 33 neutrons. The neutron is converted into a proton while also emitting an electron (called a beta particle in this context) and an electron neutrino:

n0 → p+ + e− + νe

Again, the neutron is not an elementary particle but a composite of an up quark and two down quarks (udd). It is in fact one of the down quarks that interacts in beta decay, turning into an up quark to form a proton (uud). At the most fundamental level, then, the weak force changes the flavour of a single quark:

d → u + W−

which is immediately followed by decay of the W− itself:
W− → e− + νe
```

- Gluon:

Gluons are elementary particles and mediate the STRONG NUCLEAR FORCE and the STRONG FIELD.

They bind quarks together to form particles such as protons, neutrons, and other baryons.

Gluons are unique in that they carry the strong force themselves, unlike other force-carrying bosons.

The strong nuclear force is responsible for holding atomic nuclei together.

Also, `Pions` carry the residual strong force, binding the protons and neutrons together and forming the atom nuclei.

- Higgs Boson:

The Higgs boson is an elementary particle associated with the HIGGS FIELD.
It was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012.

The Higgs boson interacts with other particles and gives them mass through the Higgs mechanism.

Its discovery confirmed the existence of the Higgs field and helped to validate the Standard Model of particle physics.

\ Strength:

The strong nuclear force is much stronger than the weak nuclear force. It is about 100 times stronger than the electromagnetic force and around 10^38 times stronger than the weak force.

The strong force is responsible for binding protons and neutrons together within atomic nuclei, overcoming the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged protons.

The weak force, on the other hand, is relatively weaker and acts over extremely short distances. It is responsible for certain types of particle interactions, such as radioactive decay.

\ Range:

The strong nuclear force has a short-range nature, operating only within the atomic nucleus. It acts on particles that are very close to each other, within a distance of about 1 femtometer (10^-15 meters).

The weak nuclear force also has a short range, similar to the strong force. It acts on particles at very short distances, but it can also manifest over slightly larger distances than the strong force, up to a few femtometers.

\ Carriers:

The strong nuclear force is mediated by gluons. Gluons are massless particles that carry the strong force between quarks, the building blocks of protons and neutrons.

The weak nuclear force is mediated by the W and Z bosons. The W bosons are charged, with a positive and a negative variety, while the Z boson is electrically neutral. These bosons are involved in processes related to the weak force, such as the decay of particles.

\ Interaction:

The strong nuclear force acts between quarks, holding them together to form protons, neutrons, and other particles. It also binds protons and neutrons within atomic nuclei.

The weak nuclear force is responsible for certain types of particle interactions, including the decay of particles such as neutrons, beta decay, and the conversion of one type of quark into another.
