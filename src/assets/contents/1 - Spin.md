> **Spin**

\ Spin of Fermions (needs two full rotations to get the same face in its wave function):

Fermions are a class of particles that obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.

Spin is a quantum mechanical property that describes the intrinsic angular momentum of fermions.

Fermions have half-integer spin values, such as 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, and so on.

The spin of fermions determines their behavior and properties, including their interactions and the way they form quantum states.

Examples of fermions include electrons, quarks, and neutrinos.

\ Spin of Bosons (needs one full rotation to get the same face in its wave function):

Bosons are a different class of particles that do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Multiple identical bosons can occupy the same quantum state simultaneously.

Bosons also have spin, but unlike fermions, their spin values are integers or zero.

The spin of bosons determines their behavior and properties, including their interactions and the way they form quantum states.

Examples of bosons include photons (particles of light), W and Z bosons, gluons, and the Higgs boson.
