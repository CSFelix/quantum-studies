> **- Quarks**

- Quarks are elementary particles and the fundamental building blocks of matter;

- They come in six different types or "flavors": `up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom`;

- Quarks carry fractional electric charges, like +2/3 or -1/3;

- They are always found in combinations of two or three to form larger particles;

- `Protons, neutrons, lambdas, sigmas, xis and omegas`, which are baryons, are made up of quarks.

> **Leptons**

- Leptons are also elementary particles and another type of fundamental matter particle;

- They come in three generations: the `electron and electron neutrino`, the `muon and muon neutrino`, and the `tau and tau neutrino`;

- Muon and muon neutrino, tau and tau neutrino are instables, are created while colliding particles and their life-time is significantly short;

- Leptons come in pairs of electron/muon/tau and its respective neutrino;

- Leptons have integral electric charges: -1 for electrons, -2 for muons, and -3 for taus;

- Electrons are the most familiar leptons and are involved in electricity, chemical reactions, and the formation of atoms.

> **Baryons**

- Baryons are a type of particle made up of three quarks;

- `Protons and neutrons` are the most common and stable baryons found in atomic nuclei;

- Others known baryons are `sigma, lambda, xi and omega`. They are instables, are created while colliding particles and their life-time is significantly short;

- Baryons play a crucial role in the structure of matter and contribute to the diversity of atomic nuclei;


```
\ The proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark (uud).

\ The neutron consists of one up quark and two down quarks (udd).

\ Σ+ (Sigma-plus): It is made up of two up quarks and one strange quark (uus).
\ Σ0 (Sigma-zero): It consists of one up quark, one down quark, and one strange quark (uds).
\ Σ- (Sigma-minus): It is composed of one down quark and two strange quarks (dss).

\ Ξ0 (Xi-zero): It consists of one up quark, one down quark, and one strange quark (uds).
\ Ξ- (Xi-minus): It is composed of one down quark and two strange quarks (dss).

\ Ω- (Omega-minus): It is made up of three strange quarks (sss).

Λ (Lambda): It consists of one up quark, one down quark, and one strange quark (uds).

> **Bosons**

- Bosons are particles that mediate the fundamental forces of nature;

- The `photon` is a boson that carries the electromagnetic force;

- The `W and Z bosons` are involved in the weak nuclear force;

- The `gluon` is the boson that carries the strong nuclear force;

- The `Higgs boson` is responsible for giving other particles mass.

> **Mesons**

- Mesons are type of boson particles that are made up of a `quark` and its respective `anti-quark`;

- The most known meson is the `pion`;

- Pions carry the `Residual Strong Force`, making the protons and neutrons be together and forming the atom nuclei.
