- Dark Matter:

Dark matter is thought to be present throughout the universe on large scales, including galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic web.

It does not emit, absorb, or interact significantly with electromagnetic radiation, making it challenging to detect directly.

Observations of galaxy rotation curves, gravitational lensing, and the cosmic microwave background provide evidence for the presence of dark matter.

Dark matter is believed to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe.

- Antimatter:

Antimatter is rare in the observable universe compared to ordinary matter.
Small amounts of antimatter have been produced and detected in laboratory settings, such as positrons (antielectrons) and antiprotons.

In natural cosmic conditions, antimatter is thought to be produced through high-energy processes, such as particle collisions and certain types of radioactive decays.

However, the abundance of naturally occurring antimatter in the universe is still an open question, as it has not been observed in large quantities outside of laboratory-created environments
