    "<b>- Pauli Exclusion Principle</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "This Principle tells that all particles can be divided into two types, `Bosons` and `Fermions`, accordingly to their behavior in the space:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Bosons** - can occupy the same space, that is, the `superposition` is true between them and do not follow the `Pauli Exclusion`;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fermions** - cannot occupy the same space, that is, the `superposition` is not true between them and do not follow the `Pauli Exclusion`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>- Properties</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fundamental Particles have a bunch of properties that describe their uniqueness, being the `Spin`, `Color`, `Flavor`, `Charge` and `Mass` the main ones. Let's see a briefly explanation for each one of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Spin** - it is not like the rotation spin you are picturing right now, but you can take this thought in consideration to understand what spin is. `Fermions` will always have non-integer spins, such as `1/2, 3/2 and 5/2`, while `Bosons` will always have integer spins, such as `0, 1 and 2`.;\n",
    "\n",
    ">> Fermions gotta take two full rotations to get the same `Wave Function` value to the origin value in the beggining of the spin (*i.e. 1, 2, 3, 2, 1*). However, Bosons gotta take only a full rotation to get the same `Wave Function` value to the origin one (*i.e. 1, 2, 1*).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Color** - one more time, it is not like the visual colors you are thinking, but you can take this thought in consideration (*yeah, I know, quantum is confusing*). Only `quarks` and `gluons` have colors;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Flavor** - no, you cannot taste the Fundamental Particles - at least so far üòÇ. Flavor is a property present only for `quarks` and `leptons` that tells if the particle is an `electron`, `tau` or `muon` and `electron neutrino`, `tau neutrino` or `muon neutrino`;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Charge** -  finally, one property we are already used to. Charge is the electrical energy of them, being positive or negative. All `quarks`, `non-neutrino leptons` and `W bosons` have charge;\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Mass** - probably this is the most known property of these particles. Mass is literally the mass of the particles. All `quarks`, `leptons`, `Z bosons`, `W bosons` and `Higgs bosons` have mass.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `Antimatter` is rare in the observable universe compared to ordinary matter;\n",
    "\n",
    "- All `fermions` have their respective antimatter, however, `bosons` does not have;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small amounts of antimatter have been produced and detected in laboratory settings, such as `positrons` (*antielectrons*) and `antiprotons`;\n",
    "\n",
    "- In natural cosmic conditions, antimatter is thought to be produced through `high-energy processes`, such as `particle collisions` and `certain types of radioactive decays`;\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, the abundance of naturally occurring antimatter in the universe is still an open question, as it has not been observed in large quantities outside of laboratory-created environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>- Dark Matter</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Dark Matter` is thought to be present throughout the universe on large scales, including galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the cosmic web;\n",
    "\n",
    "- It does not emit, absorb, or interact significantly with `Electromagnetic Radiation`, making it challenging to detect directly;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, these kind of matter are considered `cold`, the inverse of the Standard Particles seen so far, that are considered `hot`. Cold particles are those ones that travel in `low speed`, that is, `slow compared to the light`. Hot particles are those ones that travel in `high sped`, that is, `almost to the speed of light`;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Observations of `galaxy rotation curves`, `gravitational lensing`, and the `cosmic microwave background` provide evidence for the presence of dark matter;\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dark matter is believed to play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and the large-scale structure of the universe."
